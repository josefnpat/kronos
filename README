ABOUT:
  Kronos @ RIT does a great job managing time, but a horrible time presenting
  it's information on the website. This script pulls the html down (since there
  is no API), tears it apart, and builds it into an object, that one could
  use in other software if they wanted to. As for the base use of this script,
  it spits out the configured user's kronos information, and json data if one
  wanted to use it as an api. The best thing about this script is that the
  username/password is stored, and it sums up the totals for the weeks, instead
  of just giving you a total of two weeks. And there's no annoying javascript
  that logs you out while you're looking at the damned thing.

CONFIG:
  Open up config.php and put in your username and password. Surprised?
  
  Extra Credit:
  Define `$workhours` to the number of hours you work in integer form to see
  your remaining hours. (e.g.: `$workhours = 40;`)
  
RUNNING:
  Running via CLI:
    Run with `php ./build.php <arg>`
  Arguments (<arg>):
    `debug` .. Debug data.
    `json` .. outputs the objects as json.

INSTALLATION:
  curl_init() does not exist error? You need the curl libs.
  Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install curl libcurl3 libcurl3-dev php5-curl

WHAT:
  I've notice that the output can be too long for conky, so if I were you,
  I would suggest pushing the data via the json command to something else,
  or just writing a quick script in /usr/games/kronos that just calls the
  script wherever you placed it.

FAQ:

  A: Youre username/password is wrong.

  Q: Wowzers, now i'ma gettin' an "ERROR: render_min($punch_time);" thingy.

  Q: Is mah password and username safe?
  A: As safe as the config.php is, I guess.

  Q: Barf! Your code blows.
  A: Yeah, well, it's just meant to be a quick script.
